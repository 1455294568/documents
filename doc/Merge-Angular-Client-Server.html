<title>Merge Angular2 Client and Server projects</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>This document is aimed to merge ASP.NET Zero Angular 2.x Client solution to Server solution. It's assumed that you already have a project created by following <a href="Getting-Started-Angular.html">ASP.NET Core &amp; Angular 2+</a> Getting Started document.</p>

<h3>Merging Solutions</h3>

<h4 id="DocStep1">Step 1: Copy files from client project to server project</h4>
<p>
	Copy files in below screenshot from your client solution to root folder of <strong>*Web.Host</strong> project in server solution.
</p>
<p>

</p>


<h4 id="DocStep2">Step 2: Modify .gitignore file</h4>
<p>Since we copied .gitignore file from another project, we need to remove lines under "<strong># VS files</strong>" which contains "<strong>PhoneBook.AngularUI</strong>" keyword.</p>


<h4 id="DocStep3">Step 3: Modify project.json</h4>
<p>
	We need to exclude "<strong>node_modules</strong>" and "<strong>external_libs</strong>" folders from compiled folders. In order to do that, change your buildOptions in project.json like this:
	<pre lang="js">
"buildOptions": {
    "emitEntryPoint": true,
    "preserveCompilationContext": true,
    "copyToOutput": "log4net.config",
    <strong>"compile": {
      "exclude": [
        "node_modules",
        "external_libs"
      ]
    }
</strong>  }	
	</pre>
	After doing this, your project must be build successfully.
</p>

<h4 id="DocStep4">Step 4: Running the host project</h4>
<p>
	Now, we can run our host project by pressing the F5 button. We assume that, you have already applied migrations to your database and runned host project before starting this document according to <a href="Getting-Started-Angular.html">ASP.NET Core &amp; Angular 2+</a> document.
</p>

<h4 id="DocStep5">Step 5: Running the client (Angular 2.x) project</h4>
<p>
	We need to open a command prompt and navigate to "<strong>..\src\Acme.PhoneBook.Web.Host</strong>" folder. Then we need to run "<strong>npm install</strong>" command in order to install our project's dependencies.
	Then we can run "<strong>npm start</strong>" command to start our project.
</p>

<p>
	After this point, we can work on a single Visual Studio solution with our client and server projects. Since we use angular-cli for serving our client application, we cannot use same port both for our client and server apps during development.<br>
	But, we can do it when publishing our application. Let's see how.
</p>



<h3>Publish Configuration</h3>
<h4 id="PubStep1">Step 1: Configure angular-cli.json</h4>
<p>
	Our client project is published by angular-cli. In order to publish a single website using Visual Studio, first we need to modify publish directory for angular-cli. In order to do that, open <strong>angular-cli.json</strong> in your project and change value of <strong>"outDir"</strong> to <strong>"wwwroot/dist"</strong>.
	We could use "wwwroot" as outDir but, angular-cli deletes entire folder before it builds the application. So, In order not to loose other files under 
	<strong>wwwroot </strong>folder, we ued <strong>wwwroot/dist</strong>.
</p>

<h4 id="PubStep2">Step 2: Build client app before publish</h4>
<p>
	Before publishing our application using Visual Studio's publish, we need to build our angular application using angular-cli. We can do it using <strong>prepublish</strong> scripts. Add <strong>"ng build --prod"</strong> to your prepublish script in project.json. Your scripts in project.json will be like this:
	<pre lang="js">
"scripts": {
    "prepublish": [
      <strong>"ng build --prod"</strong>
    ],
    "postpublish": [ "dotnet publish-iis --publish-folder %publish:OutputPath% --framework %publish:FullTargetFramework%" ]
  }	
	</pre>
	In this way, angular-cli is going to build your client application before every publish you make.
</p>

<h4 id="PubStep3">Step 3: Move client app files to wwwroot</h4>
<p>
	We need to move files and folders under "<strong>wwwroot/dist</strong>" to "<strong>wwwroot</strong>". In order to do that, change your <strong>prepublish</strong> scripts like this:
	<pre lang="js">
"scripts": {
    "prepublish": [
      "ng build --prod",
      <strong>"robocopy %publish:ProjectPath%\\wwwroot\\dist\\ %publish:ProjectPath%\\wwwroot\\ /S /E /MOVE"</strong>
    ],
    "postpublish": [ "dotnet publish-iis --publish-folder %publish:OutputPath% --framework %publish:FullTargetFramework%" ]
  }	
	</pre>
	This command copies entire content of <strong>wwwroot\dist</strong> folder to <strong>wwwroot </strong> and deletes dist folder before publish. In this way, will have a clean wwwroot folder.
</p>

<h4 id="PubStep4">Step 4: Add middleware for angular 2.x rotues</h4>
<p>
	We need to do one more thing before publising our application. Since we host our Angular 2.x application in a ASP.NET Core website, we will have a routing problem. After publishing our application, if we refresh page when we navigate to a page in our application (for example: /admin/users), we will have a empty page. Because when we request an url like <strong>http://yourwebsite.com/admin/users</strong>, ASP.NET Core will not be able to find a matching Controller.
	In order to overcome this problem, add below code to Startup.cs file just before "<strong>app.UseStaticFiles();</strong>" line.
</p>
<pre lang="cs">
app.Use(async (context, next) =&gt;
{
    await next();

    if (context.Response.StatusCode == 404
        &amp;&amp; !Path.HasExtension(context.Request.Path.Value))
    {
        context.Request.Path = "/index.html";
        await next();
    }
});

</pre>

<p>Now, we can publish our website using Visaul Studio's publish at once.</p>
<h3>After Publish</h3>
<p>
	Our client and server applications are designed to work separately. Because of that, they have different configurations. In order to make them work together, we need to make some configurations after publish as well.
	We need to use same address configured for our host application in <strong>appsettings.json</strong> for our angular2 application. 
	Copy the value of "<strong>WebSiteRootAddress</strong>" in appsettings.json and use this value for "<strong>remoteServiceBaseUrl</strong>" and "<strong>appBaseUrl</strong>" in "<strong>appconfig.json</strong>" under "<strong>wwwroot\assets\</strong>" folder.
</p>
<p>
	Now you can view your website under "<strong>http://yourwebsite.com/index.html</strong>". If you enter only http://yourwebsite.com/, it will redirect you to swagger ui (to swagger/ui/index.html), so you need to add index.html after your website name.
</p>

Notice that, appsettings.json and appconfig.json are two different files.
