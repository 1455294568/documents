<h3>Multi Tenancy</h3>
<p>We have built a fully functional application until here. Now, we will see how 
to convert it to a multi-tenant application easily.</p>
<h4>Enable Multi Tenancy</h4>
<p>We disabled multi-tenancy at the begginning of this document. Now, re-enabling it in <strong>PhoneBookCoreModule</strong> class:</p>
<pre lang="cs">Configuration.MultiTenancy.IsEnabled = true;</pre>
<h4>Make Entities Multi Tenant</h4>
<p>In a multi-tenant application, a tenant's entities should be isolated by 
other tenants. For this example project, every tenant should have own phone book 
with isolated people and phone numbers.</p>
<p>When we implement IMustHaveTenant interface, ABP automatically
<a href="http://www.aspnetboilerplate.com/Pages/Documents/Data-Filters">filters 
data</a> based on current Tenant, while retrieving entities from database. So, we should declare that Person entity 
must have a tenant using <strong>IMustHaveTenant</strong> interface:</p>
<pre lang="cs">public class Person : FullAuditedEntity, <strong>IMustHaveTenant</strong>
{
    <strong>public virtual int TenantId { get; set; }
</strong>
    //...other properties
}</pre>
<p>We may want to add IMustHaveTenant interface to also Phone entity. This is 
needed if we directly use phone repository to get phones. In this sample 
project, it's not needed.</p>
<p>Since entities have changed, we should create a new database migration:</p>
<pre>dotnet ef migrations add "Implemented_IMustHaveTenant_For_Person"</pre>
<p>This command creates a new code-first database migration. The migration class 
adds an annotation this is needed for automatic filtering. We don't have to know 
what it is since it's done automatically. And also it adds a TenantId column to 
PbPersons table as shown below:</p>
<pre lang="cs">AddColumn(&quot;dbo.PbPersons&quot;, &quot;TenantId&quot;, c =&gt; c.Int(nullable: false, <strong>defaultValue: 1</strong>));</pre>
<p>I added <strong>defaultValue as 1</strong> to AddColumn options. Thus, 
current people are automatically assigned to <strong>default tenant</strong> 
(default tenant's id is 1).</p>
<p>Now, we can update the database again:</p>
<pre>dotnet ef database update</pre>
<h4>Run The Multi Tenant Application</h4>
<p><strong>It's finished</strong>! We can test the application. Run the project, <strong>login</strong> as 
<strong>host</strong> 
as shown blow:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Login as host" height="400" src="images/login-as-host.png" width="419" /></p>
<p>Since we enabled multi-tenancy, we see a <strong>Tenancy name </strong>input 
on login form. When we leave it <strong>empty</strong>, we login as a <strong>host user</strong>. 
Default <strong>admin</strong> password is <strong>123qwe</strong>.</p>
<p>After login, we see the <strong>tenant list</strong> which only contains a <strong>default</strong> 
tenant. We can create a new tenant:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Creating tenant" height="655" src="images/create-tenant-2.png" width="619" /></p>
<p>I created a new tenant named <strong>trio</strong>. Now, tenant list has two 
tenants:</p>
<p>
<img class="img-thumbnail" alt="Tenant list" height="497" src="images/tenant-list-with-2-tenant.png" width="871" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;I can <strong>logout</strong> and 
login as trio <strong>tenant admin</strong>:</p>
<p>
<img alt="Login as tenant" height="404" src="images/login-as-tenant.png" width="420" /></p>
<p>After login, we see that phone book is empty:</p>
<p>
<img alt="Empty phonebook of new tenant" height="210" src="images/phonebook-empty.png" width="791" /></p>
<p>It's empty because trio tenant has a completely islolated people list. You can 
add people here, logout and login as different teants (you can login as default 
tenant for example). You will see that each tenant 
has an isolated phone book and can not see other's people.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In this document, we built a complete example that covers most parts of the 
ASP.NET Zero system. We hope that it will help you to build your own 
application.</p>
<p>We intentionally used different approaches for similar tasks to show you 
different styles of development. AspNet Zero provides an architecture but does 
not restrict you. You can make your own style development.</p>
<h4>Source Code</h4>
<p>You should <a href="/Prices">purchase</a> ASP.NET Zero in order to get
<strong>source code</strong>. After purchasing, you can get the sample project 
from private Github repository:
